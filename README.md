# Stock Prediction using Financial Indicators (INF6027) This project explores whether financial indicators such as revenue growth and gross profit can be used to predict stock performance. By using machine learning models, we attempt to classify stocks as "buy-worthy" or "not buy-worthy" based on financial metrics from the 2014 financial dataset.
