**Title: Stock Prediction using Financial Indicators**

# Stock Prediction using Financial Indicators (INF6027) 
This study analyzes financial data from U.S. companies spanning from 2014 to 2018, focusing on identifying key financial indicators that influence a company's Net Income. Net Income, a key profitability metric, reflects a company's ability to generate profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. Understanding the relationship between financial indicators such as Revenue, EBITDA, Total Assets, and Total Liabilities can provide valuable insights for business strategy, financial analysis, and investment decisions. The dataset used in this study contains various financial indicators, making it a valuable resource for assessing the factors that contribute to Net Income across multiple companies.

## Research Questions
1. What financial indicators, such as Revenue, EBITDA, Total Assets, and Total Liabilities, most strongly correlate with Net Income for companies between 2014 and 2018?
2. How do these financial metrics influence Net Income across different companies in the dataset?
3. Can a regression model be developed to predict Net Income based on these key financial indicators, and how accurate is the model?


## Key Findings
The analysis revealed that EBITDA and Total Assets are the most significant predictors of Net Income, with a strong positive correlation between these variables. The linear regression model achieved an R-squared value of 0.7035, indicating that approximately 70% of the variation in Net Income can be explained by these financial metrics. However, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 421,975,192.79 indicated that the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy could be improved.

## Dataset
 The dataset used in this study consists of financial data for U.S. companies from 2014 to 2018, with key variables such as Revenue, EBITDA, Total Assets, Total Liabilities, and Net Income. The data was sourced from Kaggle and includes financial records for over 22,000 companies across the five-year period.
